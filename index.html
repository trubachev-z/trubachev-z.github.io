    <h1 class="h1">Okay, my name is Zahar, and I'm a web developer</h1>
    <!-- <img src="me.png"> -->
    <p>I've been involved in marketing for 15 years, and damn, I'm tired of it.</p>
    <p>I have a good understanding of marketing, project and team management, teaching, and now I am learning to develop websites and web applications.</p>
    <p>You can see the companies I have worked for and reviews about working with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zakhar-trubachev-57060037/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
    <p>And I also really love art and design!</p>

        <h2>Some thing about me</h2>
        <p>I am a certified pedagogical psychologist. It's been quite a while, but I still apply my knowledge in real life.</p> 
        <p>I am self-learning web development:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/cs50">CS50 course on YouTube</a>;</li>
            <li>Completed Python and Django courses from JetBrains on <a href="hyperskill.org">hyperskill.org</a>;</li>
            <li>Read books on HTML and CSS, Python, and algorithms;</li>
            <li>Explored various articles and watched video tutorials on database setup and server configuration;</li>
            <li>Also, I solve problems on <a href="https://leetcode.com/trubachev_z/">LeetCode</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I've achieved certain successes, but my knowledge is not sufficient. That's why I'm currently learning JS on <a href="https://hexlet.io/">Hexlet</a>.</p>
